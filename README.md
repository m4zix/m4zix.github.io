# Mazix Portfolio

Cybersecurity walkthroughs and write-ups.🧠 M4ZiX – Cybersecurity Portfolio
This is my personal website and portfolio — created entirely from my ideas, design choices, and vision — but built fully using black-box development with ChatGPT as my assistant.

💡 I acted as the architect, strategist, and creator. ChatGPT was my hands-on tool for converting my thoughts into code.

📦 Development Workflow
This project was developed using a prompt-driven black-box approach:

I described ideas, sections, behaviors, and styles

ChatGPT translated those into full HTML/CSS/JS code

I tested, edited, and deployed manually

All assets, content structure, design, and goals were defined by me

✅ No visual builder, no copy/paste themes — just full conceptual development through AI prompts
