## 🧠 M4ZiX – Cybersecurity Portfolio

This is my personal website and portfolio — created entirely from my ideas, design choices, and vision — but built fully using **black-box development** with **ChatGPT** as my assistant.

> 💡 I acted as the architect, strategist, and creator. ChatGPT was my hands-on tool for converting my thoughts into code.

### 📆 Development Workflow

This project was developed using a **prompt-driven black-box approach**:

- I described ideas, sections, behaviors, and styles
- ChatGPT translated those into full HTML/CSS/JS code
- I tested, edited, and deployed manually
- All assets, content structure, design, and goals were defined by me

👌 No visual builder, no copy/paste themes — just full conceptual development through AI prompts
